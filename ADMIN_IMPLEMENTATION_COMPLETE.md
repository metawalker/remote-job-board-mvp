## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Apply Database Migration**
```bash
# Option A: Use the script (if env vars are set up)
node apply-admin-migration.js

# Option B: Manual (in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor)
# Copy contents of supabase/admin-migration.sql and run
```

### 2. **Create Admin User**
```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > user_profiles
-- Set is_admin = true for your user
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET is_admin = true 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

### 3. **Access Admin Dashboard**
- Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/admin/review`
- Admin panel link will appear in user menu for admin users

### 4. **Get Jobs to Review**
```bash
# Run the scraper to get pending jobs
node test-scraper.js
```

## 🎯 Workflow

1. **Scraper runs** → Creates jobs with `is_active = false`
2. **Admin reviews** → Views jobs in admin dashboard
3. **Admin approves** → Job becomes visible (`is_active = true`)
4. **Admin rejects** → Job is deleted from database

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Only users with `is_admin = true` can access admin features
- All admin operations are protected by RLS policies
- Service role key is never exposed to client-side code
- Authentication is verified on every admin API request
